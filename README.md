# vizard

Magic Visualization

## Overview

vizard is a tiny client/server library meant to enable REPL-based data visualization in the browser (mostly) painless.

## Usage

Add vizard to your leiningen project dependencies

``` clojure
[yieldbot/vizard "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

In a repl:

``` clojure
(require '[vizard [core :refer :all] [plot :as plot])

(start-plot-server!)

(letfn [(group-data [& names]
            (apply concat (for [n names]
                            (map-indexed (fn [i x] {:foo i :bar x :biz n}) (take 20 (repeatedly #(rand-int 100)))))))]
    (plot! (p/vizard {:mark-type :area :x :foo :y :bar :g :biz :color "category20b" :legend? false} (group-data "foo" "bar" "baz" "poot"))))
```

## Local Development

First, start up figwheel
``` sh
lein figwheel
```

Next, start a normal CIDER or other nrepl client and connect as you would normally.
